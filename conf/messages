ex1.text1 = This is a program using function calls whose arguments are parsed by pointers.T
ex1.text2 = What are the final values of the variables a, b, c, d, e?

ex2.text1 = This is a program calculating the factorial.
ex2.text2 = What are the values of the variables n, r, (*pn) when the function f is returned for a third time?
ex2.text3 = (e.g.:n=1,r=2,(*pn)=3)

ex3.text1 = This is a program using dyamic memory allocation.
ex3.text2 = What are the final values of heap memory which has not been freed, and of the 
ex3.text3 = pointer variable which refer to the memory when the main function return?
ex3.text4 = e.g.:ps[0]=1,2,3  ps[3]=0,3,2)
